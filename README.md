For challenge 1, i chose a while loop because you don't know how many times you need the code to run through. The code keeps running until it hits 1.

For challenge 2, I used a loop because we check a set range of divisors. If a divisor is found, it stops. Otherwise, the number is prime.

For challenge 3, I used nested for loops since both rows and columns go from 1 to 10. It builds the table row by row.
